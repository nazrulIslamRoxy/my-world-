# Project Plan

## Title
Analyzing the Impact of Climate Change on Global Temperature and Sea Level Rise

## Main Question
How has global temperature changed over the past century, and what are the underlying trends?
What is the relationship between global temperature rise and sea level rise?
Which regions are most affected by sea level rise, and what are the implications for coastal communities?
Can we predict future trends in global temperature and sea level rise using historical data?



## Description
  This project aims to analyze the impact of climate change on global temperature and sea level rise over time.This includes analyzing ancient statistics to understand traits and patterns in temperature and sea level measurements, figuring out correlations between climate variables, and predicting future developments primarily based on ancient statistics.The project also explores the potential implications of these changes on the environment and human populations
